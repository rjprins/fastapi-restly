## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-02

First public release.

### Added

- Class-based CRUD views for async and sync SQLAlchemy sessions with generated
  list, retrieve, create, update, and destroy routes.
- React Admin compatible `AsyncReactAdminView` and `ReactAdminView` variants
  for the `ra-data-simple-rest` wire contract.
- Generated schema support for read, create, and update payloads, including
  `ReadOnly`, `WriteOnly`, `IDSchema`, `IDRef`, and timestamp schema helpers.
- Standard list query support for filtering, sorting, pagination, relation
  aliases, and pagination metadata.
- Public `RestlyError` and `RestlyConfigurationError` exception hierarchy.
- Testing utilities through `RestlyTestClient`, savepoint-only mode helpers,
  and the `fastapi_restly.pytest_fixtures` pytest plugin.

### Changed

- Consolidated framework setup on `fr.configure(...)`, including async/sync
  engine configuration and response-session commit policy.
- Renamed built-in route methods to resource-oriented names:
  `listing`, `retrieve`, `create`, `update`, and `destroy`.
- Renamed business-logic hooks to `handle_listing`, `handle_retrieve`,
  `handle_create`, `handle_update`, and `handle_destroy`.
- Standardized schema component names on `ModelRead`, `ModelCreate`, and
  `ModelUpdate`.
- Made `sort` the canonical list ordering parameter.
- Split `__contains` and `__icontains` so case-sensitive and
  case-insensitive matching have distinct public operators.
- Exposed savepoint-only testing helpers through `fastapi_restly.testing`
  instead of the top-level package namespace.

### Removed

- Removed pre-release route and hook names such as `index`, `get`, `post`,
  `patch`, `delete`, `handle_list`, and `handle_get` from the public view API.
- Removed unsupported `get_one_or_create` helpers before the first stable
  release.
- Removed internal model helpers such as `TableNameMixin`, `underscore`, and
  `utc_now` from the public API surface.
- Removed duplicate pytest fixture exports from `fastapi_restly.testing`;
  the pytest plugin path is `fastapi_restly.pytest_fixtures`.
